# WORK-IT-DONE

# Discription
For our project we decided to make a project tracking website. 

Project Requirements:
 * Use Node and Express to create RESTful APIs.
 * Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
 * Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
 * Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
 * Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
 * Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.
 * Have a polished UI.
 * Be responsive.
 * Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
 * Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
 * Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
 * Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
 * Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming   conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
 * Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).


Based on the above requirements we decided to make a trello style kanban board. Each project is equivalant to a workspace, within that project there are tasks that need to be accomplished. These tasks can be moved via drag and drop from one column to another based on the updated state of the task.
