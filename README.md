## Description

For our project we decided to make a project tracking website. 

Project Requirements:
 * Use Node and Express to create RESTful APIs.
 * Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.
 * Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
 * Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
 * Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
 * Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed.
 * Have a polished UI.
 * Be responsive.
 * Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
 * Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
 * Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
 * Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
 * Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming   conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
 * Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).


Based on the above requirements we decided to make a Trello-style kanban board. Each user is presented with a workspace where their projects can be stored. Within those projects, users can create status columns with moveable task cards. As the user progresses in completing tasks on a project, the user can move the task cards to reflect those changes - for example, from "To do" to "In progress" to "Finished".
